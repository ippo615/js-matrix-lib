js-matrix-lib
=============

A library for working with matrices and vectors in javaScript. It can handle
matrix multiplication, determinant calculations, inversions, additions and
pseudo inverses maybe other stuff too.

I plan on adding code for working with sparse matrices because I was curious
about them.

I'm also using this as an excuse to learn about Jasmine (a thingy that can
can be used to write code that can test your code). 

The actual matrix/vector code is found in the `src` directory. The testing
code can be found in the `spec` directory. The `SpecRunner.html` file and
the `lib` directory are the jasmine files (ie I didn't make them; I'm just
using them).
